Making this a required status check
How To
To make this a required status check on the pull request, follow these instructions:

The first thing you need is a public repository (GHAS is free for public repos) or a private repository with the GitHub Advanced Security license enabled
Under the Settings tab in the repository, navigate to Branches
Create a branch protection rule for your default branch - check the ‘Require status checks to pass before merging’ box
Add the dependency review job as a status check - in the example above, it’s dependency-review
If you don’t see the dependency-review to add as a status check to the branch protection, it won’t appear as an option until you initiate at least one PR on the repository that triggers this job.

In package.json, tar 2.2.2 will trigger a dependency error.

Interesting settings:
fail-on-severity  -- If there are too many "fake" failures
comment-summary-in-pr  -- probably useful for failures
deny-packages
deny-groups
show-openssf-scorecard
warn-on-openssf-scorecard-level

Scorecard info:
Each individual check returns a score of 0 to 10, with 10 representing the best possible score. Scorecard also produces an aggregate score, which is a weight-based average of the individual checks weighted by risk.

“Critical” risk checks are weighted at 10
“High” risk checks are weighted at 7.5
“Medium” risk checks are weighted at 5
“Low” risk checks are weighted at 2.5
