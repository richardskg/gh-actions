Making this a required status check
How To
To make this a required status check on the pull request, follow these instructions:

The first thing you need is a public repository (GHAS is free for public repos) or a private repository with the GitHub Advanced Security license enabled
Under the Settings tab in the repository, navigate to Branches
Create a branch protection rule for your default branch - check the ‘Require status checks to pass before merging’ box
Add the dependency review job as a status check - in the example above, it’s dependency-review
If you don’t see the dependency-review to add as a status check to the branch protection, it won’t appear as an option until you initiate at least one PR on the repository that triggers this job.

In package.json, tar 2.2.2 will trigger a dependency error.
